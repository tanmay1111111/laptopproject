# laptop price prediction project
In this project I tackled a challenging regression problem using supervised machine learning techniques. The focus of this project was to predict laptop prices based on various key features, including RAM, memory, company name, processor, and more.

To ensure accurate predictions, I performed extensive feature engineering and extraction techniques on the dataset, aiming to capture the most relevant information. This involved transforming raw features into meaningful representations that would enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

Additionally, I invested considerable effort in data cleaning, ensuring the dataset was free from inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. This step was crucial in maintaining data integrity and improving the model's overall performance.

After completing the data preparation phase, I trained several regression algorithms on the processed dataset. Through thorough experimentation and evaluation, I identified AdaBoost as the most effective algorithm, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. This highlights the robustness and predictive power of the model in estimating laptop prices accurately.

To ensure seamless deployment and accessibility, I saved the trained model in the pickle format. This allowed for quick retrieval and integration within a web application.

Leveraging the Streamlit framework, I developed a user-friendly web application that enables users to input relevant laptop features and instantly receive an estimated price prediction. This interactive interface enhances the user experience and provides valuable insights for making informed purchasing decisions.In this proj
